# FPBHCPLEX: A Feasibility Pump based Heuristic for Multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming using CPLEX #

This is a LP based heuristic for computing an approximate nondominated frontier of a Multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Program. Important characteristics of this heuristic are:

1. Can solve any (both structured and unstructured) multiobjective mixed integer linear problem. The following problem classes are supported:
    1. Objectives: 2 or more linear objectives
    2. Constraints: 0 or more linear (both inequality and equality) constraints
    3. Variables:
        1. Binary
        2. Integer variables (via reformulation into binary variables)
        3. Continuous + Binary
        4. Continuous + Integer variables (via reformulation into binary variables)
2. A multiobjective mixed integer linear instance can be provided as a input in 4 ways:
    1. ModoModel - an extension of JuMP Model
    2. LP file format
    3. MPS file format
    4. Matrix Format ( Advanced )
3. Customized for CPLEX
4. All parameters are already tuned, only timelimit is required.
5. Supports parallelization
